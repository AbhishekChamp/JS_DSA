### What do they do?

Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

### Why so many??

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### Classes

-   Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as **instances**
-   Classes are created with the **new** keyword
-   The **constructor** function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
-   Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
-   Class methods can be added using the **static** keyword
